## üìã Overview
![System Architecture](https://img.shields.io/badge/Architecture-IoT%20System-informational)

This project is a comprehensive monitoring system designed for tomato plants that collects environmental data via sensors, transmits it through MQTT, and sends it to a mobile application. The application analyzes the data to detect potential diseases in tomato plants and suggests appropriate treatments.

### System Components
- A Raspberry Pi that reads sensor data and publishes to an MQTT broker
- An Arduino that interfaces with analog sensors (particularly soil moisture)
- A set of environmental sensors (temperature, humidity, light, soil moisture)
- A mobile application that receives data and provides plant health analysis

## ‚öôÔ∏è Configuration - IMPORTANT
![Configuration](https://img.shields.io/badge/Configuration-Environment%20Variables-critical)

The system uses environment variables for configuration, which must be set in the `.env` file located in the `raspberry_pi_code` directory. 

**You need to create and modify the `.env` file to match your specific setup, especially the MQTT broker IP address.**

Create the `.env` file:

```bash
nano raspberry_pi_code/.env
```

Add the following variables, making sure to update them according to your setup:

```
# MQTT Configuration
MQTT_BROKER=192.168.1.xxx    # Replace with your MQTT broker IP address
MQTT_PORT=1883
MQTT_KEEPALIVE=60
MQTT_TOPIC=plant/tomato/sensor-data

# Soil Moisture Sensor
SOIL_MOISTURE_MIN_VALUE=0    # Value when soil is completely wet
SOIL_MOISTURE_MAX_VALUE=1023 # Value when soil is completely dry

# BH1750 Light Sensor
BH1750_ADDRESS=0x23  # Default I2C address (0x23 or 0x5C)

# Arduino Connection
ARDUINO_PORT=/dev/ttyACM0  # Check correct port with `ls /dev/tty*`
ARDUINO_BAUDRATE=9600
ARDUINO_TIMEOUT=1

# Sampling Settings
SAMPLING_INTERVAL=60  # Time between readings in seconds
```

### Finding Your MQTT Broker IP Address

If you're running the MQTT broker on another device:
1. On the device running the broker, use `ifconfig` or `ip addr` to find its IP address
2. Enter this IP address for the `MQTT_BROKER` variable

If you're running the broker on the same Raspberry Pi:
1. Use `127.0.0.1` or `localhost` for the `MQTT_BROKER` variable

### Finding the Arduino Port

To find the correct port for your Arduino:

```bash
ls /dev/tty*
```

Look for something like `/dev/ttyACM0` or `/dev/ttyUSB0` that appeared after connecting your Arduino.

## üöÄ Usage
![Runtime](https://img.shields.io/badge/Runtime-Commands-ff69b4)
![Service](https://img.shields.io/badge/Service-Systemd-lightblue)

### Starting the Monitoring System

Navigate to the raspberry_pi_code directory and run the main Python script:

```bash
cd raspberry_pi_code
python3 raspberry_pi_server.py
```

### Command Line Options

- `-e, --env`: Specify a custom path to the .env file (default: '.env')
- `-c, --config`: Specify a path to a JSON configuration file (overrides .env settings)

Example:

```bash
python3 plant_monitor.py --env production.env --config custom_config.json
```

### Running as a Service

To run the script as a systemd service on boot:

1. Create a service file:

   ```bash
   sudo nano /etc/systemd/system/tomato-monitor.service
   ```

2. Add the following content (adjust paths to match your installation):

   ```
   [Unit]
   Description=Tomato Plant Monitoring System
   After=network.target

   [Service]
   User=pi
   WorkingDirectory=/home/pi/tomato_disease_detection_app/raspberry_pi_code
   ExecStart=/usr/bin/python3 /home/pi/tomato_disease_detection_app/raspberry_pi_code/raspberry_pi_server.py
   Restart=always
   RestartSec=10

   [Install]
   WantedBy=multi-user.target
   ```

3. Enable and start the service:

   ```bash
   sudo systemctl enable tomato-monitor.service
   sudo systemctl start tomato-monitor.service
   ```

4. Check the status:

   ```bash
   sudo systemctl status tomato-monitor.service
   ```

## üìä Data Format
![Data](https://img.shields.io/badge/Format-JSON-yellow)
![Protocol](https://img.shields.io/badge/Protocol-MQTT-yellowgreen)

The system publishes sensor data to the MQTT broker in JSON format:

```json
{
  "temperature": 24.5,
  "humidity": 45.2,
  "light_intensity": 850,
  "soil_moisture": 62.3
}
```

- `temperature`: Temperature in degrees Celsius (¬∞C)
- `humidity`: Relative humidity percentage (%)
- `light_intensity`: Light level in lux
- `soil_moisture`: Soil moisture percentage (0-100%, where 100% is wettest)

### Error Values

If a sensor fails to read, the following error values are used:

- `temperature`: -999.9
- `humidity`: -999.9
- `light_intensity`: -999.9
- `soil_moisture`: -999.9

## üì± Connecting to the Mobile Application
![Mobile](https://img.shields.io/badge/Mobile-Application-9cf)
![Integration](https://img.shields.io/badge/Integration-Data%20Flow-success)

The mobile application connects to the same MQTT broker and subscribes to the sensor data topic. Make sure:

1. Your MQTT broker is accessible from both the Raspberry Pi and your mobile device
2. The topic configured in the `.env` file matches the topic your mobile app is subscribed to
3. Both systems use the same data format for compatibility

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Troubleshooting
![Diagnostics](https://img.shields.io/badge/Diagnostics-Solutions-red)
![Logging](https://img.shields.io/badge/Logging-Debug-lightgrey)

### Common Issues

1. **Cannot connect to MQTT broker**
   - Check your internet connection
   - Verify the broker address and port in your configuration
   - Ensure the MQTT broker is running and accessible

2. **DHT11 sensor reading errors**
   - Ensure proper wiring and connections
   - Verify the pull-up resistor is connected correctly
   - Try increasing the sampling interval (DHT11 needs time between readings)

3. **BH1750 sensor not found**
   - Confirm I2C is enabled on your Raspberry Pi
   - Check connections to the I2C pins
   - Verify the correct address with `i2cdetect -y 1`

4. **Arduino connection issues**
   - Check if the Arduino is properly connected via USB
   - Verify the correct port is specified in the configuration
   - Make sure the Arduino sketch is uploaded and running

5. **Service fails to start**
   - Check service logs: `sudo journalctl -u tomato-monitor.service`
   - Verify file paths in the service file
   - Ensure the Python script has execute permissions

### Logs

The system logs information and errors to the console. For more detailed debugging, you can modify the logging level in the script:

```python
logging.basicConfig(
    level=logging.DEBUG,  # Change from INFO to DEBUG for more detailed logs
    format='%(asctime)s - %(name)s - %(levelname)s - %(message)s'
)
```
